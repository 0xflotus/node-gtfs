### Breaking changes in version 1.0.0

As of version 1.0.0, all `node-gtfs` methods have changed to accept a query object instead of individual arguments. This allows for all fields of all GTFS files to be queried using this library. Most method names have been changed to be more general and more specific methods have been removed. For example, `getRoutes` now replaces `getRoutesByAgency`, `getRoutesById`, `getRoutesByDistance` and `getRoutesByStop`.

    // Old method with individual arguments, no longer supported in `node-gtfs` 1.0.0
    gtfs.getRoutesByStop(agency_key, stop_id)
    .then(routes => {
      // do something with the array of `routes`
    })

    // Query in `node-gtfs` version 1.0.0
    gtfs.getRoutes({
      agency_key: 'caltrain',
      stop_id: '123'
    })
    .then(routes => {
      // do something with the array of `routes`
    })

## [0.11.0] - 2017-07-04

As of version 0.11.0, `node-gtfs` methods don't support callbacks. Use promises instead:

    gtfs.getAgencies()
    .then(agencies => {
      // do something with the array of `agencies`
    })
    .catch(err => {
      // handle errors here
    });

Or, you use async/await:

    const myAwesomeFunction = async () => {
      try {
        const agencies = await gtfs.getAgencies();
      } catch (error) {
        // handle errors here
      }
    }
